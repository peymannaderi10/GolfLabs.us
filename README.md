# GolfLabs - Public Website

## Business Overview

GolfLabs is a 24/7 self-service golf simulator facility located in Cherryhill, New Jersey, serving the greater Philadelphia area. Our business model addresses a significant gap in the local market by providing:

- **24/7 Access**: Book and play anytime, day or night
- **Affordable Pricing**: $35/hour with no membership requirements
- **Self-Service Technology**: Fully automated booking, access, and bay management
- **Premium Equipment**: 8 bays equipped with Uneekor QED launch monitors and GS Pro software

Unlike traditional golf simulator facilities that require memberships ($200+ monthly) or charge premium rates ($75+ per hour), our automated system eliminates staffing costs, allowing us to offer competitive pricing while maintaining profitability.
